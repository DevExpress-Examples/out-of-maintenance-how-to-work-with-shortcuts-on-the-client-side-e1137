# How to work with shortcuts on the client side


<p>This example illustrates how a client action can be initiated and performed within the ASPxMemo editor via a keyboard shortcut. In this sample the editor's KeyPress client event is handled and the StringToShortcutCode and GetShortcutCodeByEvent client methods of the ASPxClientUtils object are used to identify the Ctrl-Enter key combination being pressed while the editor is focused.</p>
